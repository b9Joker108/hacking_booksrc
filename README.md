I asked ShellGPT 4.0 Turbo what the most complete, succinct and well-regarded book on hacking would be in their opinion. They chose this book. I asked Bing Copilot ChatGPT 4.0 where could I secure, the source-code for this book and they directed me to the GitHub account, from which I forked this repository.   I consulted Anna's Library for a download location for this text and I chose Z-Library.
